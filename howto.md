# How to make the Tuebor Pledge

**1. Make an investment in a Michigan startup this year.**
**2. Make another one next year.**

---

If you're in, **make your pledge public** by listing Tuebor on your LinkedIn.

Here's what you do:
```
- Go to your profile page on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/) and click the + sign to list a new job (note, this is not a 'group' but actually listed as a job on LinkedIn). Look for [Tuebor](https://linkedin.com/company/tuebororg).
- Role: Pledge Investor
- Description: Through Tuebor, I make the pledge to invest in at least one Michigan startup per year. Learn more at tuebor.org

Note: Finally, to make sure this new 'job' isn't the first listing in order on your profile, you can drag it up and down by first clicking the pencil icon ✎ and then use the up-down arrow symbol ↕ which looks like this:
