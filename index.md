**What is Tuebor?**

Tuebor is a commitment to invest in at least one Michigan-based startup per year. 

**What is the goal of Tuebor?**

The more Michigan leaders support Michigan founders, the more Michigan leaders we’ll have. Tuebor’s success will mean the State of Michigan will have more individual venture capital investors than anywhere else on earth.

**If I make the commitment, are there extra fees / costs associated with Tuebor?**

No, Tuebor is an honor commitment. Individuals make their own investments independently; Tuebor does not make investment recommendations and is not an investment advisor. 

**How much money do I need to make per investment?**

There is no minimum dollar amount to be a part of Tuebor, just that you commit to making at least one investment in a Michigan startup per year. An individual making an investment of $1,000 is the same to us as someone investing $1,000,000. 

**How do I make the commitment?**

Start now. Make an investment in a Michigan company during this calendar year and join us at Tuebor.org.
