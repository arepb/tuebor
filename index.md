**What is Tuebor?**

Tuebor is an honor-pledge commitment to invest in at least one State of Michigan-based business per year. 

**What is the goal of Tuebor?**

Our goal is to increase the number of Michigan investors backing Michigan businesses.

**Are there fees / costs associated with Tuebor?**

No, Tuebor is an honor pledge. Tuebor does not collect fees and does not in any way enter in the flow of money when you make an investment. Individuals make their own investments independently; Tuebor does not make investment recommendations and is not an investment advisor.

**How much money do I need to make per investment?**

There is no minimum dollar amount to make the Tuebor commitment. Someone who takes the Tuebor pledge can invest in a groundbreaking new Michigan technology startup each year or simply buy a single share of stock in a Michigan public company (for example: Ford, Hagerty or MillerKnoll just to name a few). An individual making an investment of $10 is the ‘same’ as someone investing $1,000,000. All efforts count toward our goal: to increase the number of Michigan investors backing Michigan businesses. 

**How do I take the pledge?**

Start now. Make an investment in a Michigan business during this calendar year and then [show the world](/howto) you've committed to take the Tuebor honor pledge, aka supporting 'Michigan's next sports team.'
