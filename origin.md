# Origin

*Tuebor* is the word found on Michigan's state flag; in Latin it means 'I will defend' and refers to the state's frontier position.

The Tuebor commitment -- as a call to arms for those who love the state's incredible founders -- was started by investors and Michiganders [Reilly Brennan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reillybrennan/) and [Chris Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopherthomas/) in 2023.
